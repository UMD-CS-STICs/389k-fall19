## Week 1

Welcome to CMSC389K!

It's exciting that you want to be prepared for class! We don't expect you to know that much coming into the first week, but this material will give you a nice headstart. 

We will be covering basic HTML and CSS in our first class. 

In class, we will be doing a live coding exercise, which we will post on this repository after class. This will be the finished product with **no guaranteed explanation**, so it's in your best interest to come to class! It will help you with the projects.

Here are a few resources that we would like you to check out before our first class. Don't worry or stress about any of it -- we will be going over it in class.
