## Specifications

We are going to be looking at a basic understanding of the HTML elements and CSS rules discussed in class.

HTML (5 points each):

1. One or more pictures - `<img />`
2. Use of multiple pages (in addition to index.html) - linking with `<a />`
3. **Text** *styling* in some way ~~shape, or form~~.
4. Create a table and fill with information (no specifications to size) - `<table />`
5. Use the resources discussed in class to find another tag that we have not covered. Use them!

CSS (5 points each):

1. Two elements must have a class (class=""), and they must be styled using css
2. Two elements must have an id (id=""), and they must be styled using css
3. Use the following css declarations:
    - display: inline
    - display: block
4. Use the following css properties (1 point each):
    - background-color
    - width
    - height
    - margin
    - padding
5. Use media queries

## Requirements

This website must be about you! Must be *somewhat aesthetic*.
Also, you may not use third party CSS files like Bootstrap and Materialize (Normalize CSS is the exception).

## Code Distribution

Clone the project folder located in this directory.

## Testing

No testing for this project in terms of public/secret tests. However, you can look at your own project by simply opening the `.html` file in your own browser!
